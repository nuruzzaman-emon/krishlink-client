During my time ground-truthing in Ethiopia, I saw a lot of maize plants. Some were thin and spindly, the soil pale and crumbly. In other plots, though, the stalks stood tall alongside legumes, climbing yams, and other vegetables. The soil was dark, moist, alive.

The difference was stark. And the best part? We know exactly why those healthy plots were doing so well—and how other farmers could transform their soils to achieve those successes, too.

The successful farmers, I learned, were focusing on soil health and sustainable productivity through the Scaling Conservation Agriculture-based Sustainable Intensification (SCASI) project, supported by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (known as CIMMYT, its Spanish acronym). With high-quality seeds, technical support, and science-based sustainable intensification technologies, SCASI aims to boost the yields and incomes of Ethiopia’s smallholder farmers and make them more resilient to climate variations.

“Family farms in Ethiopia are ‘all in’ on protecting their soil health with mulch and conservation practices to keep their crops productive in the face of scorching heat and reoccurring droughts,” Sieglinde Snapp, director of the Sustainable Agrifood Systems program at CIMMYT, tells Food Tank.

And this literally changes people’s lives. One farmer and mother told me that, before working with the SCASI project, her family was lucky to eat once a day, and now they have three meals. A single mother of three said higher income from SCASI techniques helped transform her kids’ access to education.

Farmer Adanech Bebiso says she had previously used conventional techniques, but once she began working with the SCASI initiative, her yields nearly tripled while she also improved her land health.

“This farm has improved our lives in many ways, and we are truly benefiting from this endeavor,” she tells CIMMYT.

Across more than 40 countries, CIMMYT is building farmer-centered approaches to share knowledge, implement solutions, and deepen the effectiveness of conservation agriculture. These are truly tools designed with farmers, not simply for them, which I deeply admire. And more than 75,000 smallholder farmers have benefitted from these projects so far, CIMMYT estimates.

Look, we know there’s no silver bullet to solve the climate crisis. SCASI projects, like many forms of transitioning to more regenerative practices, can call for higher costs and labor up-front. But we also know that the long-term benefits to yields and soil health—not only regarding cereal crops but also root crops like taro and sweet potato—consistently outweigh these perceived challenges, farmers find.

In the challenge, we find the solution: Let’s make the right choice the easy choice! Let’s empower farmers not only with tools to build sustainable, planet-friendly livelihoods for generations to come, but also with the financial resources they need to adopt those tools on their farmland!

And let’s make sure farmers are not just invited to the table but meaningfully involved in shaping the discussions we’re having from the start. As I saw in Ethiopia with strong CIMMYT farmer-to-farmer mentoring networks, farmers can be the strongest advocates for food system and agricultural transformation.

Interventions with the SCASI project are locally tailored by design, so they’re meant to respond to unique community needs rather than being one-size-fits-all solutions. The specific techniques that turned sickly plants into the vibrant, nourishing maize I saw in Ethiopia may not be able to be replicated verbatim in cornfields in Iowa. But the animating idea is the same: Our solutions need to start from the ground up, led by farmers.

Here at Food Tank, I love hearing stories of hope and success in the global food system, which is why I’m sharing these reflections from witnessing CIMMYT’s work in Ethiopia.

const asianFarmer = `A groundswell of knowledge and innovation recently emerged in Bogor, Indonesia during a week-long Learning Exchange on agroecology economies convened by the Agroecology Fund. More than 100 participants from 20 countries, representing-Asian grassroots organizations, advisors and donors shared experiences and strategies to strengthen local agroecology-based food systems.

The Learning Exchange made clear that for innovation, agroecology does not rely on technology transfer. At the very center of agroecology lies the principle of knowledge co-creation.

A gallery of 45 stories showcased agroecological approaches to farming and fishing across Asia. They told stories of circular economies, revived traditions and local knowledge, and securing land reform. They described triumphs and hardships of marginal farmers and fishers challenging the domination of industrial food systems and grappling with the mounting threats of climate change.

Behind the posters were grassroots innovators, grantees of the Agroecology Fund. The Agroecology Fund is a pooled, multi-donor grantmaking fund and learning connector which has provided over US$40 million in funding to support agroecology movements to strengthen resilient, healthy food systems; uphold rights; conserve biodiversity; and address climate change through sustainable, low-input agriculture.

Globally, agroecological systems are vital not only for addressing poverty and hunger but also for climate change mitigation. Agriculture alone contributes 30 percent of greenhouse gas emissions through production and use of industrial farm inputs—fertilizers and pesticides.

In a discussion on climate and agroecology entrepreneurship, Sakiul Millat Morshed of SHISUK from Bangladesh and Karan Singh of Farmversities from India presented their agricultural development models rooted in traditional knowledge. The SHISUK agroecological experience integrates rice and fish farming on Bangladesh’s floodplains, significantly boosting farmers’ year-round income by cutting paddy cultivation expenses and adding revenue from aquaculture. Before SHISUK stepped in, the seasonal inundation of the floodplains pushed farmers out of their livelihoods and deeper into poverty.

In Sakiul Millat’s view, “traditional knowledge is social capital that helps a community to grow together.” SHISUK’s success comes from blending social capital with modern science, managing natural resources wisely and adapting to climate change. In addition to better income and nutritional benefits to the farmers, strengthening entrepreneurship on floodplains improves soil moisture, groundwater recharge, while diminishing pollution.

Karan Singh of Farmversitiy, a grassroots organization based in Rajasthan, India, shared how his work with young farmers, men and women, has dissuaded migration to cities, revived traditional farming practices, and introduced value-added farm-products as additional source of income.

Nantawan Manprasong of The Field Alliance shared their approach, from Vietnam and Thailand, to collaborating with government and community-supported school meal programs, where children not only eat traditional agroecological food, but also grow it at their school. Strengthening this public procurement demand mechanism fortifies an agroecology economy and makes visible and viable traditional food varieties. Manprasong described nutritional improvements from agroecology, and the health and environmental benefits of pesticide-free farming practices and climate change resilience.

Consumer awareness is likewise key to the growth of agroecology economies. Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGS) were discussed as a popular, low‑cost mechanism for building trust between producers and consumers. Community-led certification validates the application of agroecological principles. Muhil Kannaiyan of the Thalavady Farmers Foundation, India, said “we leverage agroecology’s sustainability, ecological, health and ethical values to build consumer trust.” The Foundation’s multilingual smartphone app ‘Farmfit’ gives farmers direct access to markets—enabling them to reach consumers directly and bypass intermediaries. The application helps with pricing and distribution challenges and results in better returns on food production.

But agroecology economies receive little investment on an uneven playing field already biased towards heavily subsidized industrial agroecology. Cristino Panerio of the Philippines, an advisor to the Agroecology Fund, spoke to the ways in which agroecological farmers are often left out of a longer value chain, which favor use of chemical inputs over bioinputs.

Critical to a strong local agroecology economy is strengthening territorial markets, often in collaboration with municipal governments, a strategy employed from Turkey to Malaysia. These markets function best with sufficient local supply of agroecological produce, which is much aided by robust networks of food-producing cooperatives.

Serikat Petani Indonesia (SPI), a national farmers organization and the learning exchange co-host in Indonesia, described how farmers’ market and cooperativism empowers otherwise marginal farmers. After years of struggle for peasants’ rights to land and seeds, establishing food sovereignty zones has helped achieve productivity, at par with industrial farming—but at significantly lower costs. And FAO studies confirm that agroecological practices can deliver higher long-term yields without external inputs, and enhance crop resilience in the face of an uncertain climate.

SPI’s work underscores how localized control and collective enterprise can lay the groundwork for an agroecology food economy. Recalling her experience with the empty supermarket shelves during Covid and setting up markets for agroecology products across Bangkok, Anne Lapapan of The Assembly of the Poor, Thailand, stated that the pandemic showed how neither consumers nor farmers can rely on long supply chains dominated by transnational corporations for their food and seeds. During the pandemic, the Assembly of the Poor ensured agroecological vegetable supply in Bangkok’s urban neighborhoods.

Participants from India shared experiences leveraging government programs to finance agroecology. Sridhar Radhakrishnan, sustainable agriculture specialist and AEF advisor from India, suggested that to scale agroecology, organizations need to explore local financing beyond traditional donor models. He cited examples from India.

The discussions underscored the global forces that conflict with the growth of localized agroecological economies. Azra Sayeed of Roots for Equity, Pakistan, spoke to the layered vulnerabilities faced by smallholder farmers—ranging from war and climate crises to debt, economic restructuring, and displacement in the name of development. AEF advisor Lim Ching cautioned against biodiversity offsets, noting that related schemes such as carbon credits had not yet delivered on their sustainability and equity claims. She cautioned that such offsets can have perilous outcomes for communities with irreversible ecological damage.

A report by the Global Alliance for the Future of Food estimates that a global transition to agroecology would require a US$250-430 billion investment per year to align our food systems with the 1.5°C Paris Agreement. We have a long way to go. The Asia Learning Exchange clearly brought to light dozens of impactful community-based initiatives hungry for investment and capable of leading an agroecological shift in the world’s food systems.

const africanFarmar = `This piece is part of the weekly series “Growing Forward: Insights for Building Better Food and Agriculture Systems,” presented by the Global Food Institute at the George Washington University and the nonprofit organization Food Tank. Each installment highlights forward-thinking strategies to address today’s food and agriculture related challenges with innovative solutions. To view more pieces in the series, click here.

When African leaders gathered this year at the Africa Food Systems Forum, in Dakar, they faced critical opportunities. They are charting sustainable financing pathways to help transform food and nutrition futures while confronting geopolitical shifts and budget cuts across the G7 countries. Those cuts, including the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development earlier this year, have left Africa’s food and agriculture systems dangerously exposed.

While the exact size and depth of the cuts and their impact are still unclear, ONE’s engagement with African agribusiness leaders indicate early signs of reversals of progress on farmer productivity, gender and youth engagement, climate resilience, nutrition security, and market access. Already burdened by climate shocks and strained by international trade wars and the burgeoning debt crises, African governments are struggling to fill the gaps. Sadly, the most vulnerable— children, women, the displaced and the elderly—will bear the brunt of the cuts unless urgent action is taken to develop sustainable financing pathways. This will require African-led solutions, leveraging data and innovation, investing in policy alignment, and private and public solutions to ensure food security for millions and safeguard nutrition for future generations.

Given the diversity and complexity of the food ecosystem on the Continent, approaches to filling the gaps and truly propelling a pathway to self-sufficiency in financing the transformation of the agrifood landscape will need to be tailored to the unique country context. But there are at least six opportunities that leaders in the ecosystem should consider, adopt, and implement:

First, each country must develop a robust understanding of the public and private funds that are currently available at the federal, state and local levels to drive food systems’ transformation. This will require considerable engagement beyond formal budgets from the ministries of agriculture. But it will require an ecosystem approach to capture the funds available for other key components including research, humanitarian food aid interventions, manufacturing, and climate-smart infrastructure to drive value addition and logistics to enhance regional trade.

There must also be a commitment to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the use of these funds, instituting robust systems and structures, leveraging AI to ensure transparency, accountability and reporting on the use of the funds. This data will also enable stakeholders to re-allocate funds from where they are being underutilized to the highest areas of need and impact.

Second, African countries must design cohesive and robust national agrifood research infrastructure supported by the private sector to drive demand-driven research and sustainability. The Continent invests under 1 percent of its agricultural GDP in research—with allocated budgets often under-disbursed—resulting in underfunded, understaffed, and ineffective institutions.

In a much-needed shift, governments could prioritize modernizing research infrastructure, improve internal management, and strengthen coordination across universities, research institutes, and farmer extension services. Critically, they can try establishing accountability frameworks, including volunteer advisory boards, complete with farmer engagement to set the annual research agendas, track demand-driven impact, and attract private-sector funding.

Nigeria alone, for example, has over 60 research institutes, six dedicated agricultural universities and over 75 universities that offer degrees in agriculture. However, this research landscape is not funded or shaped by the private sector; this results in a disconnect between these institutions’ activities and their impact on sector transformation. In contrast, Côte d’Ivoire provides an exemplary model: its National Center for Agricultural Research (CNRA) is largely funded by private producers through the Inter-Professional Fund for Agricultural Research and Extension (FIRCA) which directs 75 percent of subscription fees into commodity-specific research.

Third, the public sector could create enabling policy frameworks and support national de-risking instruments that attract private sector financing. The recent 16th Malabo Montpellier Panel report, MONEYWISE: Policy Innovations to Finance Agrifood Systems, estimates that the private and public sectors on the Continent will need US$77 billion annually until 2030 to propel food systems in Africa. Case studies from Malawi, Morocco, and Rwanda demonstrate the promise and potential impact of innovative financing models including funds, coupled with policy and institutional engagement from development banks and capital market authorities.

Specifically, in the case of Morocco, robust national plans–Plan Maroc Vert and Strategie Génération Green–provided the ecosystem policy framework, and propelled de–risking and incentive interventions which attracted private sector investment, doubling agricultural GDP. Similar ecosystem solutions are required across the Continent and demand a bold commitment to private, public and civil society partnerships that invest in robust roadmaps and accountability frameworks, similar to the Moroccan example.

Fourth, African nations could generate new tax revenue directly linked to the exportation of unprocessed food commodities. For example, Africa produces over 75 percent of the world’s cocoa, yet receives barely 2 percent of the global profit. Export taxes that favor domestic processing, like Côte d’Ivoire’s 14.6 percent levy on raw cocoa beans, can generate revenue while incentivizing value addition.

Beyond exports, “sin taxes” on unhealthy foods and sugary drinks both reduce the health burdens and costs associated with treating the linked diseases but also generate revenue which could be allocated to drive food systems transformation without placing further strain on public budgets. South Africa generated over US$400 million in revenue within two years of introducing its sugary drinks tax in 2018.

In addition, civil society organizations must play a critical role in educating the public about the benefits of these additional taxes and hold governments accountable for how they are utilized to promote value addition and reduce the cost of locally sourced nutritious food.

Fifth, African countries can create credible and innovative mechanisms for diasporic investment in the agrifood industry. The African Diaspora sends home over US$100 billion in remittances annually, which can be systematically channeled toward driving agrifood transformation. Partnering with nonprofit organizations such as African Food Changemakers, an online community of entrepreneurs from 50 African countries, would provide access to the credible business opportunities for interested investors from the Diaspora. 

In addition, the Africa Food System Forum and other convening platforms could create virtual and in person deal rooms for the Diaspora to connect with credible venture and private equity fund managers operating on the Continent, allowing for pooling of resources to drive investment and scaling.

Finally, global food and agriculture infrastructure must prioritize the transfer of data, logistics, production, delivery mechanisms and the associated funding mechanisms to trusted African institutions. More specifically, global institutions like the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the World Food Programme, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, and the CGIAR system should focus on strengthening local organizations and transition planning for research systems, seed banks, and other forms of intellectual property, procurement and the management of humanitarian and school feeding programs, critical to the growth and self-sufficiency of the African food ecosystem. This will require clear signals from the major G7 government and philanthropic funders, with the necessary incentives and timelines for country ownership. 

It is time for African leaders to recognize the opportunity to develop robust pathways to finance the food systems transformation required to truly drive growth and nutrition security. What is needed now is the political will and accountability from governments to develop robust financing policies, the mechanisms to channel domestic resources to strengthen the capacity and efficacy of the public sector, the engagement of the private sector to drive sustainable and inclusive growth, and the full participation of civil society to ensure that no one is left behind.

const economicalAgro = `When we look at food in grocery stores, school meals, or farmers markets, we can tell its price, calories, and basic nutritional composition. But behind the nutrition label lies an untapped dimension of value: food’s true quality. We measure medicine with high-resolution to each molecule, yet food has remained a black box despite being the most powerful determinant of human and planetary health.

This blind spot costs lives and weakens our economies. Poor diets are responsible for an estimated 17 million deaths each year, while the hidden costs of food systems, from chronic disease to soil degradation, exceed US$20 trillion annually, more than twice what the world spends on food itself.

Why Measurement Matters

We cannot fix what we do not measure. Food quality data, grounded in comprehensive and standardized molecular analysis, must become a central metric for how we measure, manage, and build value across food and health systems. Without knowing what’s actually in our food, the tens of thousands of molecules, we cannot design food systems that sustain health.

It’s time to build a Food Intelligence Economy, a system that integrates food quality data, artificial intelligence (AI), and human capacity to innovate solutions that regenerate farms, improve health, and drive economic value for healthy diets from sustainable food systems for all.

A Turning Point for Global Nutrition

For a century, nutrition science has focused on a few dozen molecules including essential vitamins and crude measures of total fat, carbohydrate, and protein. This focus has saved millions from deficiency diseases and shaped public health as society industrialized. With the leading cause of death today no longer being deficiency, but diet-related chronic disease, we must urgently evolve our approach. 

Humanity stands at a critical inflection point. We have the science and technology to precisely measure food at the molecular level and link it directly to environmental and health outcomes. What’s needed now is the motivation, coordination, and capital to mobilize this intelligence at scale.

What Is the Food Intelligence Economy?

Just as genomics revolutionized medicine, unlocking breakthroughs that reshaped prevention and health care, a Food Intelligence Economy can redefine food systems, transforming how we measure, design, and create value from food.

A Food Intelligence Economy integrates three interconnected pillars: 

First, food-quality data. Standardized multi-omics and environmental datasets that capture the molecular signatures of foods. 

Second, the use of artificial intelligence. AI is used to analyze, synthesize, and generate insights, predictive models, and design solutions.

And third, human capacity. Through education, entrepreneurship, social networks, and governance to translate data insights into innovation for food system solutions.

Together, these pillars create a continuous feedback loop translating food quality data into intelligence, intelligence into action, and action into measurable value for people and planet. This intelligence fuels solutions across the entire food system. From breeding crops for nutrient density and climate resilience to adopting regenerative agricultural practices that restore soil health. From developing alternative proteins and functional foods that complement medical nutrition therapies such as GLP-1, to reformulating and reducing ultra-processed foods for better health outcomes.

It extends from labeling for food quality and authenticity to product design and recipe formulation for school and hospital meals. It even extends to reusing food by-products and waste in the circular economy as new functional food innovations. By embedding intelligence in every link of the value chain, the Food Intelligence Economy transforms food into a generator of economic, environmental, and human capital, creating new markets, improving public health, and aligning profit with planetary wellbeing.

From Food Quality Data to Design of Food System Solutions

Imagine a world where algorithms taste food through their molecules, where crop breeders use predictive models to enhance nutrient density and resilience, and where school and hospital meals are designed with the same precision as medicine.

Unlocking this potential requires collective action supported by the integrated pillars of the Food Intelligence Economy: food-quality data, artificial intelligence, and human capacity. Together, these pillars enable us to grow and design diverse, nutrient-dense foods, rewarding biodiversity, soil health, and innovation in reformulation and product design. They also help make nutritious foods the most accessible and affordable choice, aligning incentives and markets with true value. And they empower societies to amplify the connection between food and health, creating food environments, policies, and cultural norms that make healthy, sustainable eating the default. 

When data, AI, and human capacity intersect across these levers, they convert the complexity of food into actionable intelligence, connecting scientific insight to market transformation and wellbeing.

Investing in Human Capacity

Technology alone will not transform food systems. Building a Food Intelligence Economy calls for equal investment in people. We must strengthen the capacity of scientists, farmers, chefs, entrepreneurs, educators, and communicators to turn data into action.

Empowering national laboratories globally to analyze local foods with standardized multi-omics tools will ensure data equity across regions. Training innovators and enterprises to use molecular insights will enable the design of culturally relevant and affordable products. Strengthening governance, education, and storytelling will help translate these insights into smarter procurement, informed policies, and healthier behaviors. 

This approach also unlocks economic growth, particularly in rural economies that are most impacted by food and nutrition inequalities. Redirecting even a fraction of the resources that global health systems spend treating preventable diet-related diseases toward measuring food with the precision of medicine, and translating that knowledge into real-world solutions, would yield compounding returns: healthier populations, stronger ecosystems, and inclusive markets built on food intelligence.

The Opportunity Ahead

Humanity has mapped the genome and sequenced viruses in real time. We can now map the molecules of our meals. In doing so, we will unlock the next frontier wellbeing.

A Food Intelligence Economy can create an innovation engine that empowers every nation to design foods and food systems that nourish people, restore ecosystems, and generate shared economic value. Food is information. The more precisely we measure it, and the more intelligently we use it, the better we are nourished. 

This marks a paradigm shift in our relationship with food: one that recognizes the molecules within it a blueprint for a thriving, equitable, and sustainable future for all.
